PhishGuard AI

Phishing Detection & Incident Triage Tool
by CyberDudeBivash Pvt Ltd

PhishGuard AI is a privacy-first, security-engineer-built tool that helps teams analyze phishing attempts, extract indicators, assess risk, and respond correctly — before credentials are lost or accounts are compromised.

Built from real incident response experience.
Designed for engineers, SOC teams, startups, and SMBs.

 Why PhishGuard AI Exists

Too many suspicious emails

No clear way to judge real risk

Slow or incorrect response

Alert fatigue instead of action

Most tools detect.
PhishGuard AI focuses on triage + response.
